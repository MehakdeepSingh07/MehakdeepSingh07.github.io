             Why choose a Border collie as your companion dog?      
        </h1>
        <p>
            <strong> Border collies </strong> are a herding breed that can be 
            traced back to viking era. So, they're very intelligent 
            (infact they're considered the <strong> most 
            intelligent </strong> dog breed there is) and hence, they are very easy
            to train. And since they have been bred for centuries to herd sheep and 
            other livestock and work closely with farmers, they have developed an
            unparalled skill set for herding and paying full attention to commands
            at the same time. Which is why they are also considered as the
            <strong> best hearding </strong> dog breed as well. They can keep an
            unblinking eye on the sheep while lending an ear to the farmer. 
            Another favorable characteristic to consider is that they are a medium
            sized breed that generally weighs between 35 - 45 lbs. Things to consider
            would be that they generally have very high energy so they must be 
            excercised regularly. Although, not so much for puppies but adult 
            Border collies are basically impossible to over-exercise. They often come
            with a double coat, so they tend to shed quite a bit all year round. 
            So, get ready to brush their coat atleast a few times per week. They
            are a very sensitive breed as well, so be gentle with them. The calmer you
            remain the more attention they'll be paying you. They are generally born 
            with semi-errect ears. They also have the <strong> cuttest </strong> 
            puppies out of all dog breeds (although, I might be a bit biased!).
